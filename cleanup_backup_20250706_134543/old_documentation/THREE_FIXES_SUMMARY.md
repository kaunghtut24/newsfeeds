# 🎉 Three Critical Issues Fixed

## Summary of All Fixes Applied

This document summarizes the three critical issues that were reported and successfully fixed:

---

## ✅ **Issue 1: Source Management Enhancement**
**Problem**: Users could only toggle sources on/off and add new sources, but couldn't edit or delete existing sources.

### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **Backend Changes:**
- **Added `/api/sources/edit` endpoint** for editing source name and URL
- **Added `/api/sources/delete` endpoint** for removing sources
- **Added `reload_config()` function** to update global variables after changes
- **Enhanced error handling** for source operations

#### **Frontend Changes:**
- **Added edit (✏️) and delete (🗑️) buttons** to each source in the UI
- **Implemented `editSource()` method** with user prompts for name/URL changes
- **Implemented `deleteSource()` method** with confirmation dialog
- **Added CSS styling** for action buttons

#### **Features Added:**
- ✅ **Edit Source**: Change source name and/or URL
- ✅ **Delete Source**: Remove sources with confirmation
- ✅ **Persistent Changes**: Updates saved to config.json
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper validation and user feedback
- ✅ **UI Integration**: Seamless buttons in source list

## ✅ **Issue 2: Ollama Model Selection Fix**
**Problem**: Error when trying to save different Ollama models: "Error saving model: Unexpected token '<'"

### **Root Cause:**
The `/api/ollama-model` endpoint was missing, causing the frontend to receive a 404 HTML error page instead of JSON.

### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **Backend Changes:**
- **Added `/api/ollama-model` POST endpoint** for saving selected models
- **Integrated with config.json** to persist model selection
- **Added LLM summarizer reinitialization** when model changes
- **Proper JSON error handling** and validation

#### **API Endpoint:**
```http
POST /api/ollama-model
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "llama3:8b"
}
```

#### **Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Ollama model updated to: llama3:8b",
  "model": "llama3:8b"
}
```

#### **Features Added:**
- ✅ **Model Selection**: Save any available Ollama model
- ✅ **Persistent Storage**: Model choice saved in config.json
- ✅ **Live Updates**: LLM summarizer reinitializes with new model
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper JSON responses, no more HTML errors

---

## ✅ **Issue 3: AI Summarization Prefix Removal**
**Problem**: AI summaries still started with "Here is a summary of the article in 2-3 clear sentences:"

### **Root Cause:**
Despite prompt improvements, the AI model was still adding its own prefixes to summaries.

### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **Prompt Engineering:**
- **Enhanced prompts** with explicit instructions to avoid prefixes
- **Added negative examples** ("Do not include any introductory phrases like 'Here is' or 'This is'")
- **More direct instructions** ("Start directly with the facts")

#### **Post-Processing:**
- **Added `_clean_summary_prefixes()` method** to remove any remaining prefixes
- **Comprehensive prefix detection** for various AI-generated introductions
- **Applied to both sync and async summarization methods**

#### **Prefixes Removed:**
- "Here is a summary of the article in 2-3 clear sentences:"
- "Here is a concise summary of the article:"
- "Here's a summary:"
- "This is a summary:"
- "Summary:"
- "Article summary:"
- And many more variations

#### **Before vs After:**

**Before:**
> "Here is a summary of the article in 2-3 clear sentences: Tesla has achieved a major breakthrough in autonomous vehicle technology..."

**After:**
> "Tesla has achieved a major breakthrough in autonomous vehicle technology, successfully demonstrating a fully autonomous Model Y driving from its factory to a customer's location."
